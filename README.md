# 🧬 Breast Cancer Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to **detect breast cancer** using clinical data. The goal is to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on features derived from cell nuclei present in digitized images.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 📥 Load and explore the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset**
- 🧹 Preprocess the data (handle missing values, feature scaling, etc.)
- 📊 Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand patterns
- 🤖 Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
- 🎯 Evaluate using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall
- 📈 Predict cancer diagnosis on new/unseen data

---

## 🔍 Dataset

- **Source**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset  
- **Features**: 30 real-valued input features (mean, standard error, and worst values of cell nuclei characteristics)
- **Target**: Diagnosis (`M` = malignant, `B` = benign)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Click the **"Open in Colab"** button above  
2. Run all cells sequentially  
3. Upload the dataset if prompted (or use `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`)

## ✅ Results

- Achieved over **95% accuracy** with multiple classifiers
- Model performance evaluated using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
